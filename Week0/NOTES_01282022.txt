- C++ History
- Data types
    - int
    - double
    - float
    - char
    - custom data types
        - class
        - struct

* class VS struct *
class   
    - Members are private by default
    - Memory allocation happens on the heap
    - It is a reference type data type
struct
    - members are public by default
    - Memory allocation happens on a stack
    - It is a value type data type

* Object Based Programming
    1. Encapsulation
        Bundling of data, along with methods that operate on the data
            into a single unit.
    2. Abstraction / Data Hiding
        'Write to the interface and not to the implementation.'
* Object Oriented Programming
    3. Inheritance
        Mechanism where you can to derive a class from another class for a hierarchy of classes that 
        share a set of attributes and methods. You can use it to declare different kinds of exceptions,
        add custom logic to existing frameworks, and even map your domain model to a database.
    4. Polymorphism
        Concept that you can access objects of different types through the same interface.
        Each type can provide its own implementation of this interface.

C++ provides the following for classes/struct:
    1. Default constructor
    2. Assignment
    3. Copy constructor
    4. Destructor
    5. * Move Assignment *
    6. * Move Copy *
