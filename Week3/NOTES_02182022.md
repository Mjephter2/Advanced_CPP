### Review [cstr (c strings)](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string/c_str), [Review printf](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/c/fprintf), [scanf/fscanf](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/c/fscanf), [enum](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/enum)

Our String class contains 2 fields
1. str: an array containing the characters
2. len: an integer representing the length of the string

Recall the Runtime Stack

## The rule of three / five [[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_three_(C%2B%2B_programming))]
- Rules of thumb in C++ for the building of exception-safe code and for formalizing rules on resource management.
- The rules prescribe how the default members of a class should be used to achieve these goals systematically.

### When to use copy constructor?
- passing by value
- returning by value
- initializing with an object of the same type

## Exception Safety Examples
- [copy-and-swap](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/More_C%2B%2B_Idioms/Copy-and-swap)

### Walk through and understand all methods from string.cpp, specially **operator=** and **sort** methods
